Valenski
========

A lightweight set of [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) mixins, classes, resets and values that might come in handy at times.

# Installation

    bower install valenski

Or

    npm install valenski

Then include them in your `SCSS` file

    @import "bower_components/valenski/valenski";

Or

    @import "node_modules/valenski/valenski";

Note that you can also include only some of the files.

    @import "node_modules/valenski/mixins";

`classes.scss` and `reset.scss` require both `mixins.scss` and `values.scss`.
